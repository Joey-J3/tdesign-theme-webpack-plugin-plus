# tdesign-theme-webpack-plugin

A webpack plugin designed to customize styles with a yuheng theme, which overrides the default styles of the tdesign light theme.

## Install
  - npm install -D tdesign-theme-webpack-plugin

```js
const ThemeWebpackPlugin = require('tdesign-theme-webpack-plugin');

const options = {
  tdLibDir: path.join(__dirname, "./node_modules/tdesign-vue"),
  indexFileName: "index.html",
  generateOnce: false,
  output: '/css',
}

const themePlugin = new ThemeWebpackPlugin(options);
// in config object
plugins: [
    themePlugin
  ]
```
Add this plugin in `plugins` array.


| Property | Type | Default | Descript |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tdLibDir | string | - | This is path to tdesign directory in your node_modules |
| indexFileName | string | index.html | File name of your main html file, in most cases it is `index.html` which is default |
| generateOnce | boolean | false | Everytime webpack will build new code due to some code changes in development, this plugin will run again unless you specify this flag as `true` which will just compile your styles once |
| output | string | - | This is path of your bundle output relative to your dist directory |


```

If you `index.html` file is not being generated by build process then add following code in your `index.html` or whatever is the name of html main file and add `indexFileName: false` in options. This way you can better place your below script in your html file according to your needs.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/yuheng-color.less" />
<script>
  window.less = {
    async: false,
    env: 'production'
  };
</script>
```
